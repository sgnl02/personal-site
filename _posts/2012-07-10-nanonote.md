Last week I got a new present, my second 
Copyleft Hardware device: the 
[Ben Nanonote](http://sharism.cc/specs/).
Meaning a lot of fiddling just like my Neo FreeRunner.<br/>
Both the hardware and the software are great for what it's supposed to be doing:
light applications.

Below is my experience with the Ben Nanonote.

##Updating the software image

This is done using a Linux system, first you'll need to install the xburst-tools:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install xburst-tools
{% endhighlight %}

Download the update script and make it executable:

{% highlight bash %}
$ wget http://downloads.qi-hardware.com/software/images/NanoNote/Ben/reflash_ben.sh
$ chmod +x reflash_ben.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Boot the Ben Nanonote into 
[USB BOOT mode](http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/USB_BOOT_mode),
you can detect this by executing:

{% highlight bash %}
$ lsusb
{% endhighlight %}

If the device is present in the list (there are no physical indicators that you're in
USB BOOT mode) run the script:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo ./reflash_ben.sh
{% endhighlight %}

When it's done, it should restart and boot into graphical mode.

##Ethernet over USB

###Linux

Plug in the Ben Nanonote and execute the following:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ifconfig usb0 192.168.254.100
{% endhighlight %}

Making sure it has the given IP address:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ifconfig usb0 | grep inet
{% endhighlight %}

If everything went ok, it should have the IP address and you can ping to check for a 
connection:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ping 192.168.254.101
{% endhighlight %}

###Mac OS X

You'll need to turn on Internet Sharing:

System Preferences &rarr;
Sharing &rarr;
Internet Sharing

You can ping to the device now:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ping 192.168.254.101
{% endhighlight %}

##Installing software

First you'll need to change the root password on the Ben Nanonote:

{% highlight bash %}
$ passwd
{% endhighlight %}

Enter your new root password so you can SSH to it and install software.

I found
[an excellent blogpost written by Ernest Kugel](http://erikugel.wordpress.com/2010/03/27/the-ben-nanonote-from-qi-hardware/)
describing on how to do that.

I decided to install MPD, MPDAS and NCMPC, because I'm a MPD-addict and I would like to
scrobble my listens to Last.fm:

{% highlight bash %}
$ opkg install mpd-mini
$ opkg install mpdas
$ opkg install ncmpc
{% endhighlight %}

##Setting up MPD

Creating the files and folders needed by MPD:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd ~
$ mkdir music
$ mkdir .mpd
$ cd .mpd/
$ touch database log state
$ mkdir playlists
{% endhighlight %}

It would be convenient to have the MicroSD showing up after booting and having it mounted
automatically so it can be used by MPD:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mount /dev/mmcblk0p1   /sdcard
{% endhighlight %}

Look under /mnt/ for the actual name of the MicroSD card, it's always mmcblk0p[NUMBER] and
you can set any other name for your card if you wish.

The next step is to make a 
[symlink to the music directory so MPD can have access to it](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Using_Multiple_Directories_Under_Parent):

{% highlight bash %}
$ ln -s /mnt/mmcblk0p1/ /root/music
{% endhighlight %}

The configuration file lives in /etc/ for MPD:

{% highlight bash %}
$ vim /etc/mpd.conf
{% endhighlight %}

This is what my configuration looks like:

{% highlight apache %}
# Files and settings
music_directory        "~/music"
playlist_directory     "~/.mpd/playlists"
db_file                "~/.mpd/database"
log_file               "~/.mpd/log"
pid_file               "~/.mpd/pid"
follow_inside_symlinks "yes"

# Audio Output
audio_output {
    type               "oss"
    name               "My OSS Device"
    driver             "oss"
    mixer_type         "software"
    mixer_control      "pcm"
}
{% endhighlight %}

__Note:__
Change the volume on the Ben Nanonote first before you start playing music, since it's 
__extremely loud__!

Settings &rarr;
Gmenu2X &rarr;
Global Volume: 1

When you change the volume in NCMPC, it should be noted that it takes a few seconds
for the volume to increase or decrease.

##Setting up MPDAS

When MPDAS is unable to connect to the internet to submit your scrobbles, it can store
your listened songs from MPD into 
[it's cache file](http://50hz.ws/mpdas/)

{% highlight bash %}
$ touch ~/.mpdascache
{% endhighlight %}

The configuration file lives in /etc/ for MPDAS:

{% highlight bash %}
$ vim /etc/mpdasrc
{% endhighlight %}

This is what my configuration looks like:

{% highlight apache %}
username = [USERNAME]
# create md5 password:
# echo -n password | md5sum
password = [MD5 HASH OF PASSWORD]
debug = 0
{% endhighlight %}

And you're good to go.

##Watching movies

Although the screen is a little small, you can play videos with Mplayer. I have watched a 
movie of 2 hours on a full charge with full brightness on. The battery is _almost_
drained afterwards. Pretty neat!

You convert videos with the commandline program ffmpeg2theora, the installation steps are
below. After it's installed, run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ffmpeg2theora YOURVIDEO -channels 2 --samplerate 44100 
\-x 320 -y 240 --speedelvel 0 -o OUTPUT.OGV
{% endhighlight %}

###Mac OS X

Download [ffmpeg2theora](http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/download.html) so you
can convert videos.

###Linux

And for Linux:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg2theora
{% endhighlight %}
