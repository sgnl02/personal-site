I have finally updated my website.

Right now it has <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/PrioritizeVisibleContent">prioritised content</a>, loading stylesheets and scripts as early as possible for the most important content on the webpage.

I have added better support for WAI-ARIA landmarks and screen readers in general with lang-attributes and a skip-link and what else.
There is an <a href="https://github.com/matatk/landmarks/releases">excellent extension</a> that navigates through these.

##Experimenting

I am experimenting with <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading/#interesting-ie">(a)synchronous loading times</a> to make loading non-blocking.

And I am not sure what I should do with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching">caching of my pages and my assets</a>, I check from time to time with <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest</a> to see how my site fares.

##Things to do

Minifying inlined stylesheets, JavaScript and HTML with Jekyll.
